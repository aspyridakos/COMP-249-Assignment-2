# Inheritance Assignment (Java)
COMP249_A2

Introduction:
The goal of this assignment was to understand how multiple inheritance of classes works in Java. Collaborated with group member Anne Bastien.

Learning targets met:

- understanding the relationship between ancestor and derived classes (inheritance)
- understanding the difference between "public", "private", "protected" and "package" access rights
- overriding the "equals()" method
- accessing attributes of imported class packages
- using "super" and "this" to access constructors and attributes of classes
